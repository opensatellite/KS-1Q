Note:
    [1]: A net cannot be modified for repair if:
         - it is hardwired, preserved, or global;
         - the sink pin is a clock pin;
         - the sink pin has negative max-delay slack allowance;
         - the sink and driving pins are placed in the same cluster.

    [2]: A location is not feasible for inserting a delay buffer if the estimated minimum delay to be inserted might exceed the max-delay slack allowance of the sink pin.
